# EXPERIMENTAL

***EXPERIMENTAL*** WebGL support for Leaflet.

Expect bugs all around, and do not use unless you're really know what you're doing.

### Development

A [gobble](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble) toolchain is needed to mix the javascript with the GLSL shaders and create something that a web browser can understand. Run `npm install`, then `npm run-script watch`.
